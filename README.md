JobListing is a modern, full-stack web application designed to connect employers and job seekers. Built with a powerful Spring Boot backend and a dynamic React frontend, it features a secure, role-based system where employers can manage their job postings and candidates can browse and apply for opportunities.

The project leverages Google OAuth2 for seamless authentication and demonstrates key principles of modern web development, including RESTful API design, secure session management, and granular, role-based access control (RBAC).
