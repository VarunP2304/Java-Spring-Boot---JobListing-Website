# JobListing: A Full-Stack, Role-Based Job Portal

   

JobListing is a modern, full-stack web application designed to connect employers and job seekers. Built with a powerful Spring Boot backend and a dynamic React frontend, it features a secure, role-based system where employers can manage their job postings and candidates can browse and apply for opportunities.

The project leverages Google OAuth2 for seamless authentication and demonstrates key principles of modern web development, including RESTful API design, secure session management, and granular, role-based access control (RBAC).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Java JDK 21 or newer
  * Maven 3.8 or newer
  * Node.js 16 or newer
  * MongoDB running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`

### Backend Setup

1.  **Configure Google OAuth2 Credentials**

      * Create a file named `application.yml` in `src/main/resources`.
      * **IMPORTANT:** Ensure this file is listed in your `.gitignore` to keep your secrets safe\!
      * Set your `client-id` and `client-secret` as environment variables in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ's Run/Debug Configurations). The `application.yml` file should reference them like this:
        ```yaml
        spring:
          security:
            oauth2:
              client:
                registration:
                  google:
                    client-id: ${GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
                    client-secret: ${GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}
        ```

2.  **Run the Backend Server**

    ```shell
    # Navigate to the backend project directory
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```shell
    # Navigate to the frontend project directory
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the Frontend Server**
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìà Future Enhancements

This project serves as a strong foundation. Future improvements could include:

  * **Advanced Filtering:** Allow candidates to filter jobs by location, experience level, and job type.
  * **Applicant Tracking:** Enhance the "Apply" feature to allow employers to view a list of candidates who have applied to their jobs.
  * **Unit & Integration Testing:** Implement JUnit and Mockito tests on the backend to ensure code quality and reliability.
  * **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically test and deploy the application.
